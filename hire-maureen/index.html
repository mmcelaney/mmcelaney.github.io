			<h3>Hire Me</h3>
          <p>I'm currently super happy in my role as a Developer Advocate at IBM Watson Data Platform, where I get to do cool things with outreach around cloud data, analytics, and offline first apps.</p>
          <p>My tech community organizing includes Girl Develop It Burlington, Burlington Ruby Conference, UX Burlington Conference, Offline Camp, many other smaller community events around the US. I've also spoken at quite a few meetups and conferences about technology and building community and taught workshops for Girl Develop It. I have an extensive network and positive presence amongst developer communities around the world. I'm also pretty fun to work with and love collaborating with folks who are also passionate about technology. I'm currently based in Vermont and would not be open to relocation, but very happy and accustomed to working on a remote friendly team.</p>
          <p>Get in touch at maureen.mcelaney[at]gmail[dot]com to start a conversation about working together. Even if something isn't a great fit for me right now, I'm always happy to see if it's a good fit for someone in my network!</p>
