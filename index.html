					<h4>My Work Work</h4>
					<p>Currently I work at a software engineering firm that builds applications and websites for the automotive industry. My team is focused on supporting our engineering organization via developer support, automation, and building and maintaining tools that make our developers more productive.

					<h4>My Community Work</h4>
					<p>I founded the Burlington chapter of Girl Develop It in 2013, and currently I work with my co-leader to manage an 8-person volunteer team focused on providing learning and community resources to women who want to learn how to code. I am passionate about fostering an inclusive tech community, which led me to co-organize 2 tech conferences as well as sit on the board of LaunchVT.</p>

					<h4>My Blog</h4>
					<p>My love affair with writing began in Ms. Cardomom's class in 6th grade. In my blog you'll find musings from my personal experiences and rantings about society at large. I'm interested in learning more about how to fight for those who don't have a voice, supporting underserved communities, and chronicling my adventures living in the frosty North.</p>
