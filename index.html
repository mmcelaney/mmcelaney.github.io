					<h4>My Blog</h4>
					<p>My love affair with writing began in Ms. Cardomom's class in 6th grade. <a href="https://momack.medium.com/">In my Blog</a> you'll find things that interest me about technology, musings from my personal experiences, and rantings about society at large. I'm interested in learning more about how to fight for those who don't have a voice, supporting underserved communities, and chronicling my adventures living in the frosty North.</p>
